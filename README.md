# Wrangling and  Data Analyzis
 In this project called Data Preparation and Analysis, we had to collect data from various sources and various formats, evaluate their quality and order, and then clean them using Python and its libraries. The dataset we processed is the archive of tweets from the Twitter user dogrates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates peopleâ€™s dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
